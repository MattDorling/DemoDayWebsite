                <h2>Hardware</h2>
                <p> We aimed to make RoboGardener reliable and adaptable to different types of garden envrionments. Three factors were crucial to achieve this goal in the hardware: the design of the robot body, the design of the collection mechanism, and the electronic
                    parts </p>

                        <h2>Rugged Body</h2>
                        <p>The body consists of 6 off road wheels and a waterproof plastic storage to operate in rough environment. The storage uses 2 actuators to dispose collected pine cones in a mechanism similar  to a dump truck. </p>

                        <p>Our spike-based rubberised passive collection mechanism is mounted on the back of the robot. The wheels collect pine cones where RoboGardener goes without using any additional power. This mechanism will be noiseless and will minimize the risk of the robot harming any
                            garden life by reducing contacting surface with the ground. It can also pick up multiple pine cones at a time.</p>

                <h2>Market Research</h2>
                <p>We believe there is a strong market need for RoboGardener.</p>
                <div class="index align-left">
                    <p>In recent years, there has been a huge resurgence in robotic lawn mowers across the world. The global robotic lawn mower market is expected to grow from $530 million in 2018 to over $1.2 billion in 2025. But despite this resurgence, our research suggests that not many robotic solutions are present for gardening problems other than mowing. </p>     
                    <p>One gardening problem that comes to mind is the removal of debris and something that is more than likely to be a part of that debris are pinecones. Removing these requires bending down for long periods of time, picking them up one by one and a lot of the time, they are present in very large numbers. This can prove to be a monotonous, repetitive task that not only takes up a large amount of time but can also increase the risk of Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) which is a condition caused by constant repeated motion. 
                        This is of particular concern amongst the elderly who are more likely to garden in higher numbers.
                    </p>

                        <br>
                        <figcaption> According to <a href="http://working-well.org/articles/pdf/Gardening.pdf">88 percent of Canadian chiropractors</a>  , gardening is the number one source of back and neck pain.</a> </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>And this is where RoboGardener comes in. Our product traverses your garden, gathering any pinecones it encounters, allowing you to circumvent these long, menial tasks and focus on the aspects of gardening that you enjoy without having to worry about the cleanliness of your lawn.</p>

In the Webots simulator, we ran RoboGardener on a variety of gardens with various levels of pinecone densities: the results are shown in the graph above. We can see that performance scales roughly linearly with the density of pinecones. At these rates, in a typical garden of 100m^2 with 400 pinecones, RoboGardener will complete in just over 11 minutes. Initial pinecone clustering and distribution can certainly make a difference, this is an area that we really would have liked to have explored in further testing had we more time.</p>

                            <p>The key component in achieving these PPM figures is the CV aspect of RoboGardener. In earlier iterations of RoboGardener, the navigation was based on a pure random walk algorithm found in robots such as entry level vacuum cleaners (e.g. Roomba). An issue we encountered was that since RoboGardener would travel in straight lines until it hit an object, at which it randomly picked a new direction to travel in, it would frequently miss pinecones that were right to the sides of the path it was travelling on, particularly in environments with low pinecone densities. The addition of CV allows RoboGardener to essentially enlarge it's field of vision and specifically hunt out pinecones that it can detect using its camera.</p>

                            <h3>Effect of YOLOv5 CV Accuracy on Performance</h3>
                        </header>
                        <div class="content">
                            <p>We also performed testing to see the effect of adjusting our YOLOv5 computer vision (CV) accuracy within Webots, and seeing what effect it had on robot performance. The idea behind this test was to try and find the range of acceptable CV accuracies where the robot would still perform in a satisfactory manner.</p>
                            <div class="image fit">
                                <img src="images/cv_accuracy_graph.png" alt="Graph of CV accuracy"/>
                            </div>
                            <p>The CV accuracy was manually adjusted in Webots at varying levels: an accuracy of 100% means that the robot has a perfect recall rate of 100%. The average number of pinecones collected per minute (PPM) was measured at these varying accuracy levels, in two garden environments of different pinecone densities. The results are shown in the graph above; degradation of PPM compared to perfect CV accuracy is displayed on the vertical axis. The measure of degradation compared to perfect CV, instead of the raw PPM values, was used to normalize the data (it is difficult to see the difference between the two density gardens when comparing raw PPM values).</p>

                            <p>Robot performance barely suffers in the high density environment: this is because with a high pinecone density, even with poor CV accuracy, it is likely that the robot will bump into a pinecone purely by chance anyway. This is not the case with the low density environment: with few pinecones, the reliance on CV is much stronger, so the performance of the robot correspondingly suffers much greater with poor CV accuracy. However, we only expect poor CV performance in the absolute worst conditions (e.g. when a majority of the camera is obscured), so are happy that in most cases the PPM degradation hit will only be relatively minor.</p>

                            <p> We also performed real world testing of our trained YOLOv5 computer vision algorithm. This is the machine learning model that we hand trained on over 100 images of pinecones, and filmed videos around the Meadows to test with! To see how robust our vision system was, team members simulated dirt on the camera lens as may happen during normal operation of the RoboGardener, and were delighted to see that pinecones were still accurately detected to an impressive, albeit lower, degree. This shows the resilience of our machine learning against dirt and demonstrates our work as a viable real product:</p>

                            <p>In addition, since the performance of the CV is largely based on the internal pinecone ML model, the performance of the CV can continually be improved via software updates even after the user has purchased their RoboGardener. By adjusting simulator settings to reflect real world conditions, we are more confident in the transfer of RoboGardener from Webots to the real world.</p>

                <h2>Market Research</h2>
                <p>We believe there is a strong market need for RoboGardener.</p>
                <div class="index align-left">
                    <p>In recent years, there has been a huge resurgence in robotic lawn mowers across the world. The global robotic lawn mower market is expected to grow from $530 million in 2018 to over $1.2 billion in 2025. But despite this resurgence, our research suggests that not many robotic solutions are present for gardening problems other than mowing. </p>     
                    <p>One gardening problem that comes to mind is the removal of debris and something that is more than likely to be a part of that debris are pinecones. Removing these requires bending down for long periods of time, picking them up one by one and a lot of the time, they are present in very large numbers. This can prove to be a monotonous, repetitive task that not only takes up a large amount of time but can also increase the risk of Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) which is a condition caused by constant repeated motion. 
                        This is of particular concern amongst the elderly who are more likely to garden in higher numbers.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <a href="http://working-well.org/articles/pdf/Gardening.pdf">According to 88 percent of Canadian chiropractors , gardening is the number one source of back and neck pain.</a> 
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>And this is where RoboGardener comes in. Our product traverses your garden, gathering any pinecones it encounters, allowing you to circumvent these long, menial tasks and focus on the aspects of gardening that you enjoy without having to worry about the cleanliness of your lawn.</p>

                                        RoboGardener is great at traversing gardens to collect fallen pinecones. We
                                        could <b>rapidly develop solutions</b> to <b>expand</b> RoboGardener's
                                        capabilities to <b>other gardening chores</b>. This may include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>collecting other garden debris like apples, acorns, conkers and pine needles
                                        </li>
                                        <li>cutting grass</li>
                                        <li>raking leaves</li>
                                        <li>scattering grass seed or fertiliser</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    We could easily retrain the vision system and develop <b>detachable and
                                        interchangable tools</b> to accommodate these.

                                    <p>RoboGardener is currently a fairly small machine, making it the <b>perfect
                                            size</b> to fit in <b>most gardens</b> without colliding into objects. We
                                        could provide a <b>larger version</b> with a larger body, battery and collection
                                        area that would suit <b>larger areas</b> of land, which could include
